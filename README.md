# Homebrew-formula Flatcam

This is the tap repository for homebrew [FlatCAM](http://flatcam.org/).

## Installation

```sh

brew tap tomoyanonymous/flatcam

brew install flatcam

```

## Caution

It depends on Qt4 from `cartr/qt4`, not homebrew-core taps.

It also depends on gcc to install a fortran compiler required from scipy. An installation of gcc takes over an hour to build.
